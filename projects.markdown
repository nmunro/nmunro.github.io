## Projects

As a commercial dev much of my work has been private and not publicly available, work that I am able to share will be listed here.

### Common lisp

- [MTG-API](https://github.com/nmunro/mtg-api): A library for querying the magicthegathering.io API.
- [CL-tutorials](https://github.com/nmunro/cl-tutorials): A repo for the code used in my [Common Lisp tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1J47RqBfY6VgLUZ5YSYkqw).
