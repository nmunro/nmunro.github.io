## Introduction ##

Welcome back, in this tutorial we will begin looking at how to work with SQL databases, specifically [SQLite3](https://sqlite.org/index.html), [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/), and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/). We will be using the [mito](https://github.com/fukamachi/mito) [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_mapping) to create user models and save them to the database using the `form` we created previously. `Mito` itself is a basic ORM and includes several [mixins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixin) to provide additional functionality, we will use one called [mito-auth](https://github.com/fukamachi/mito-auth) to provide password hashing and salting.

It is important to know that `mito` is based on top of a SQL library known as [SXQL](https://github.com/fukamachi/sxql), we will occasionally use `SXQL` to write queries with `mito`, while it's not _always_ required to use SXQL, there are times where it will make life easier. To achieve this, I elected to `:use` SXQL in my package definition.

{% highlight common_lisp %}
(defpackage ningle-tutorial-project
  (:use :cl :sxql)
{% endhighlight %}

Part of working with databases using an ORM is creating the initial database/tables and managing changes over time, called `migrations`, `mito` appears to have a migrations system, although I was unable to get it working, but I developed a means by which to apply migrations, so perhaps in a future tutorial the subject can be revisited. As such, in addition to seeing how to connect to the respective SQL databases, we will write implementation specific migration functions.

We will follow the example of setting up a secure user registration system across all three SQL implementations. One thing to bear in mind is that it is beyond the scope of this tutorial to instruct how to setup MySQL or PostgreSQL, I would recommend learning how to set them up using [docker](https://www.docker.com/). All that having been said, let's have a look at the different databases and how to connect to them!

Please bear in mind that when working with SQLite remember to add `.db` to your `.gitignore` as you most certainly don't want to accidentally commit a database into git! SQLite, being a file based database (unlike MySQL and PostgreSQL) will create a file that represents your database so this step only applies to SQLite.

## Installing Packages ##

To begin with we will need to ensure we have installed and added the packages we need to our project asd file, there are three that we will be installing:

- [mito](https://github.com/fukamachi/mito)
- [mito-auth](https://github.com/fukamachi/mito-auth)
- [ingle](https://codeberg.org/martianh/ingle/)

As normal you will need to add them in the `:depends-on` section. Please note however that there is an issue in `mito-auth` that prevents it from working in MySQL, I have submitted a [fix](https://github.com/fukamachi/mito-auth/pull/5) but it has not been merged yet, so for now you can use [my branch](https://github.com/nmunro/mito-auth/), if you do, please ensure you check it out via git into your `quicklisp/local-projects` directory.

{% highlight common_lisp %}
:depends-on (:clack
             :cl-dotenv
             :djula
             :cl-forms
             :cl-forms.djula
             :cl-forms.ningle
             :ingle
             :mito
             :mito-auth
             :ningle)
{% endhighlight %}

Mito is a package for managing models/tables in our application, mito-auth is a `mixin` that enables models to have a secure password field, not all models will need this, but our user model will! `ingle` is a small library that includes some very useful utilities, one of which is a `redirect` function which will be very useful indeed!

Now that that is done, we must set up the middleware, you might remember from [Part 3](/2025/01/30/ningle-3.html) that middleware is placed in the `lack.builder:builder` function call in our `start` function.

## SQL Middleware ##

Mito provides middleware to establish and manage database connections for `SQLite3`, `MySQL`, and `PostgreSQL`, when you build your solution you will need to pick a database implementation, for production systems I suggest `PostgreSQL`, but if you are just starting out, you can use `SQLite`.

### SQLite3 ###

{% highlight common_lisp %}
(defun start (&key (server :woo) (address "127.0.0.1") (port 8000))
    (djula:add-template-directory (asdf:system-relative-pathname :ningle-tutorial-project "src/templates/"))
    (djula:set-static-url "/public/")
    (clack:clackup
      (lack.builder:builder
       :session
       `(:mito
         (:sqlite3
          :database-name ,(uiop:getenv "SQLITE_DB_NAME")))
       (:static
        :root (asdf:system-relative-pathname :ningle-tutorial-project "src/static/")
        :path "/public/")
       *app*)
     :server server
     :address address
     :port port))
{% endhighlight %}

### MySQL ###

{% highlight common_lisp %}
(defun start (&key (server :woo) (address "127.0.0.1") (port 8000))
    (djula:add-template-directory (asdf:system-relative-pathname :ningle-tutorial-project "src/templates/"))
    (djula:set-static-url "/public/")
    (clack:clackup
      (lack.builder:builder
       :session
       `(:mito
         (:mysql
          :database-name ,(uiop:native-namestring (uiop:parse-unix-namestring (uiop:getenv "MYSQL_DB_NAME")))
          :username ,(uiop:getenv "MYSQL_USER")
          :password ,(uiop:getenv "MYSQL_PASSWORD")
          :host ,(uiop:getenv "MYSQL_ADDRESS")
          :port ,(parse-integer (uiop:getenv "MYSQL_PORT"))))
       (:static
        :root (asdf:system-relative-pathname :ningle-tutorial-project "src/static/")
        :path "/public/")
       *app*)
     :server server
     :address address
     :port port))
{% endhighlight %}

### PostgreSQL ###

{% highlight common_lisp %}
(defun start (&key (server :woo) (address "127.0.0.1") (port 8000))
    (djula:add-template-directory (asdf:system-relative-pathname :ningle-tutorial-project "src/templates/"))
    (djula:set-static-url "/public/")
    (clack:clackup
      (lack.builder:builder
       :session
       `(:mito
         (:postgres
          :database-name ,(uiop:native-namestring (uiop:parse-unix-namestring (uiop:getenv "POSTGRES_DB_NAME")))
          :username ,(uiop:getenv "POSTGRES_USER")
          :password ,(uiop:getenv "POSTGRES_PASSWORD")
          :host ,(uiop:getenv "POSTGRES_ADDRESS")
          :port ,(parse-integer (uiop:getenv "POSTGRES_PORT"))))
       (:static
        :root (asdf:system-relative-pathname :ningle-tutorial-project "src/static/")
        :path "/public/")
       *app*)
     :server server
     :address address
     :port port))
{% endhighlight %}

## Testing The Connection ##

Before we go further with building models and migration functions, we should test that the connections work and the most basic of SQL statements. We will be working on our register controller, so that seems like as good a place as any to place a simple check.

{% highlight common_lisp %}
(setf (ningle:route *app* "/register" :method '(:GET :POST))
    (lambda (params)
        (let ((query (mito:retrieve-by-sql "SELECT 2 + 3 AS result")))
            (format t "Test: ~A~%" query))

        (let ((form (cl-forms:find-form 'register)))
        ...
{% endhighlight %}

Here, in the controller we have added a small (temporary) check to ensure that the database connections are set up correctly, when you run the application and perform a `GET` request on this route, you should see the output printed in the console for:

    Test: ((RESULT 5))
    
It might look a little odd, but rest assured that this is proof that everything is right and the connection works! We will be removing this later as it serves just as a small check. So with that done, we can begin to look into writing our first model, our user model.

## Creating Models ##

Models are a way to represent both a generic object, and any specific object of that type in a relational database system. For example you might have a Book model, that represents a book table, however a book is just a way to classify something any doesn't tell you anything specific about any individual book. So here we will create a User model, that refers to all users, but each instance of a User will contain the specific information about any given user.

We will create a new file called `models.lisp`:

{% highlight common_lisp %}
(defpackage ningle-tutorial-project/models
  (:use :cl :mito)
  (:export #:user))

(in-package ningle-tutorial-project/models)

(deftable user (mito-auth:has-secure-password)
  ((email    :col-type (:varchar 255) :initarg :email    :accessor email)
   (username :col-type (:varchar 255) :initarg :username :accessor username))
  (:unique-keys email username))
{% endhighlight %}

Now, `mito` provides a `deftable` `macro` that hides some of the complexities, there is a way to use a regular class and change the `metaclass`, but it's much less typing and makes the code look nicer to use the `deftable` syntax. It is important to note however that we use the `mixin` from `mito-auth` called `has-secure-password`. Obviously this mixin wouldn't be needed in all of our models, but because we are creating a user that will log into our system, we need to ensure we are handling passwords securely.

## Writing Migrations ##

Now that we have this we need to write the migration code I mentioned earlier, databases (and their models) change over time as application requirements change, as columns get added, removed, changed, etc it can be tricky to get right and you certainly would prefer to have these done automatically, a stray SQL query in the wrong connected database can do incredible damage (trust me, I know!), so migrations allow us to track these changes and have the database system manage them for us. 

This code will set up connections to the implementation we want to use and delegate migrations to mito, so pick your implementation and place it in `migrations.lisp`.

### SQLite3 ###

{% highlight common_lisp %}
(defpackage ningle-tutorial-project/migrations
  (:use :cl :mito)
  (:export #:migrate))

(in-package :ningle-tutorial-project/migrations)

(defun migrate ()
  "Explicitly apply migrations when called."
  (dotenv:load-env (asdf:system-relative-pathname :ningle-tutorial-project ".env"))
  (format t "Applying migrations...~%")
  (mito:connect-toplevel
    :sqlite3
    :database-name (uiop:native-namestring (uiop:parse-unix-namestring (uiop:getenv "SQLITE_DB_NAME"))))
  (mito:ensure-table-exists 'ningle-tutorial-project/models:user)
  (mito:migrate-table 'ningle-tutorial-project/models:user)
  (mito:disconnect-toplevel)
  (format t "Migrations complete.~%"))
{% endhighlight %}

### MySql ###

{% highlight common_lisp %}
(defpackage ningle-tutorial-project/migrations
  (:use :cl :mito)
  (:export #:migrate))

(in-package :ningle-tutorial-project/migrations)

(defun migrate ()
  "Explicitly apply migrations when called."
  (dotenv:load-env (asdf:system-relative-pathname :ningle-tutorial-project ".env"))
  (format t "Applying migrations...~%")
  (mito:connect-toplevel
    :mysql
    :database-name (uiop:native-namestring (uiop:parse-unix-namestring (uiop:getenv "MYSQL_DB_NAME")))
    :username (uiop:getenv "MYSQL_USER")
    :password (uiop:getenv "MYSQL_PASSWORD")
    :host (uiop:getenv "MYSQL_ADDRESS")
    :port (parse-integer (uiop:getenv "MYSQL_PORT")))
  (mito:ensure-table-exists 'ningle-tutorial-project/models:user)
  (mito:migrate-table 'ningle-tutorial-project/models:user)
  (mito:disconnect-toplevel)
  (format t "Migrations complete.~%"))
{% endhighlight %}

### PostgreSQL ###

{% highlight common_lisp %}
(defpackage ningle-tutorial-project/migrations
  (:use :cl :mito)
  (:export #:migrate))

(in-package :ningle-tutorial-project/migrations)

(defun migrate ()
  "Explicitly apply migrations when called."
  (dotenv:load-env (asdf:system-relative-pathname :ningle-tutorial-project ".env"))
  (format t "Applying migrations...~%")
  (mito:connect-toplevel
    :postgres
    :database-name (uiop:getenv "POSTGRES_DB_NAME")
    :host (uiop:getenv "POSTGRES_ADDRESS")
    :port (parse-integer (uiop:getenv "POSTGRES_PORT"))
    :username (uiop:getenv "POSTGRES_USER")
    :password (uiop:getenv "POSTGRES_PASSWORD"))
  (mito:ensure-table-exists 'ningle-tutorial-project/models:user)
  (mito:migrate-table 'ningle-tutorial-project/models:user)
  (mito:disconnect-toplevel)
  (format t "Migrations complete.~%"))
{% endhighlight %}

It will be necessary to add these two files into the `:components` section of your project asd file.

{% highlight common_lisp %}
  :components ((:module "src"
                :components
                ((:file "models")
                 (:file "migrations")
                 (:file "forms")
                 (:file "main"))))
{% endhighlight %}

Just remember if you are using MySQL or PostgreSQL, you will need to ensure that the database you want to connect to exists (in our case ntp), and that your connecting user has the correct permissions!

## Running Migrations ##

Now that everything is set up, we will need to perform our initial migrations:

{% highlight common_lisp %}
(ningle-tutorial-project/migrations:migrate)
{% endhighlight %}

If this has worked, you will see a lot of output SQL statements, it's quite verbose, however this only means that it is working and we can move onto actually creating and saving models.

## Removing Connection Check ##

Now that we have migrations and models working we should remember to remove this verification code that we wrote earlier.

{% highlight common_lisp %}
(let ((query (mito:retrieve-by-sql "SELECT 2 + 3 AS result")))
    (format t "Test: ~A~%" query))
{% endhighlight %}

## Registering & Querying Users ##

What we are going to do now is use the user register form and connect it to our database, because we are registering users we will have to do some checks to ensure since we stated that usernames and email addresses are unique, we might want to raise an error.

{% highlight common_lisp %}
(when valid
    (cl-forms:with-form-field-values (email username password password-verify) form
        (when (mito:select-dao 'ningle-tutorial-project/models:user
                                 (where (:or (:= :username username)
                                             (:= :email email))))
                            (error "Either username or email is already registered"))
{% endhighlight %}

We can see from this snippet here that mito uses the SXQL [Domain Specific Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) for expressing SQL statements. Using the `select-dao` we can query the user table and apply `where` clauses using a more Lispy like syntax to check to see if an account with the username or email already exists. Such DSLs are common when interacting with SQL inside another programming language, but it's good to know that from what we learned earlier that it can handle arbitrary SQL strings or this more Lispy syntax, so you can use pure SQL syntax, if necessary.

While having this check isn't necessary, it does make the error handling somewhat nicer, as well as exploring parts of the mito api. We will also add a check to raise an error if the passwords submitted in the form do not match each other.

{% highlight common_lisp %}
(when (string/= password password-verify)
    (error "Passwords do not match"))
{% endhighlight %}

If both of these pass (and you can test different permutations of course), we can continue to using mito to create our first user object!

{% highlight common_lisp %}
(mito:create-dao 'ningle-tutorial-project/models:user
                                           :email email
                                           :username username
                                           :password password)
{% endhighlight %}

The final thing to add is that we should redirect to another route, which we can do with the `ingle:redirect` function.

{% highlight common_lisp %}
(ingle:redirect "/people")
{% endhighlight %}

You will notice that we are redirecting to a route that doesn't (yet) exist, we will write the controller below after we have finished this controller, the `multiple-value-bind` section of which, when completed, looks like this:

{% highlight common_lisp %}
(multiple-value-bind (valid errors)
        (cl-forms:validate-form form)
    (when errors
        (format t "Errors: ~A~%" errors))

    (when valid
        (cl-forms:with-form-field-values (email username password password-verify) form
            (when (mito:select-dao 'ningle-tutorial-project/models:user
                    (where (:or (:= :username username)
                                (:= :email email))))
                (error "Either username or email is already registered"))

            (when (string/= password password-verify)
                (error "Passwords do not match"))

            (mito:create-dao 'ningle-tutorial-project/models:user
                :email email
                :username username
                :password password)
        (ingle:redirect "/people"))))
{% endhighlight %}

## Getting All Users ##

We will look at two final examples of using mito before we finish this tutoral, as mentioned earlier we will write a new `/people` controller, which will list all the users registered in the system, and we will create a `/people/:person` controller to show the details of an individual user.

Starting with the `/people` controller, we create a controller like we have seen before, we then use a `let` binding to store the result of `(mito:retrieve-dao 'ningle-tutoral-project/model:user)`, this is how we would get all rows from a table represented by the class `'ningle-tutorial-project/models:user`. We then pass the results into a template.

{% highlight common_lisp %}
(setf (ningle:route *app* "/people")
      (lambda (params)
        (let ((users (mito:retrieve-dao 'ningle-tutorial-project/models:user)))
          (djula:render-template* "people.html" nil :title "People" :users users))))
{% endhighlight %}

The html for this is written as such:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}{% extends "base.html" %}{% endraw %}

{% raw %}{% block content %}{% endraw %}
<div class="container">
    <div class="row"    >
        <div class="col-12">
            {% raw %}{% for user in users %}{% endraw %}
                <div class="row mb-4">
                    <div class="col">
                        <div class="card">
                            <div class="card-body">
                                <h5 class="card-title"><a href="/people/{% raw %}{{ user.username }}{% endraw %}">{% raw %}{{ user.username }}{% endraw %}</a></h5>
                                <p class="card-text"><a href="/people/{% raw %}{{ user.email }}{% endraw %}">{% raw %}{{ user.email }}{% endraw %}</a></p>
                                <p class="text-muted small"></p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            {% raw %}{% endfor %}{% endraw %}
            {% raw %}{% if not users %}{% endraw %}
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col text-center">
                        <p class="text-muted">No users to display.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            {% raw %}{% endif %}{% endraw %}
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
{% raw %}{% endblock %}{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

## Getting A Single User ##

In our individual person view, we see how a route may have variable data, our `:person` component of the URL string, this will be either a username or email, it doesn't really matter which as we can have a SQL query that will find a record that will match the `:person` string with either the username or email. We also take advantage of another `ingle` function, the `get-param`, which will get the value out of `:person`. We use a `let*` binding to store the `user` derived from `:person` and the result of `mito:select-dao` (using the `person`), we then pass the `user` object into a template.

As we saw before this query was used to check for the existence of a username or email address in our `register` controller.

{% highlight common_lisp %}
(setf (ningle:route *app* "/people/:person")
      (lambda (params)
        (let* ((person (ingle:get-param :person params))
               (user (first (mito:select-dao
                              'ningle-tutorial-project/models:user
                              (where (:or (:= :username person)
                                          (:= :email person)))))))
          (djula:render-template* "person.html" nil :title "Person" :user user))))
{% endhighlight %}

And here is the template for an individual user.

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}{% extends "base.html" %}{% endraw %}

{% raw %}{% block content %}{% endraw %}
<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-12">
            <div class="row mb-4">
                <div class="col">
                    {% raw %}{% if not user %}{% endraw %}
                        <h1>No users</h1>
                    {% raw %}{% else %}{% endraw %}
                        <div class="card">
                            <div class="card-body">
                                <h5 class="card-title">{% raw %}{{ user.username }}{% endraw %}</h5>
                                <p class="card-text">{% raw %}{{ user.email }}{% endraw %}</p>
                                <p class="text-muted small"></p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                    {% raw %}{% endif %}{% endraw %}
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
{% raw %}{% endblock %}{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

## Conclusion ##

This was a rather large chapter and we covered a lot, looking at the different means by which to connect to a SQL database, defining models, running migrations and executing queries, of course we are just getting started but this is a massive step forward and our application is beginning to take shape. I certainly hope you have enjoyed it and found it useful!

To recap, after working your way though this tutorial you should be able to:

- Explain what a model is
- Explain what a migration is
- Write code to connect to a SQL database
- Implement a model
