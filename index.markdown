## Personal

I'm a software engineer/tutor in the North West of England, where I work for [Elixir](https://www.elixirsoftware.co.uk/) as the head of back end engineering. I work in [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), which I have used in various companies over the years.

I've been programming in one form or another for the last twenty years, with a BSc in Computer Science and ten years experience in the industry. My primary programming language is Python, which I started using in 2008 and have continued to use ever since.

In addition to my job, I also have a [Common Lisp](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1J47RqBfY6VgLUZ5YSYkqw) video tutorial series on YouTube, feel free to check it out, I'm not actively making videos right now, as I am writing up the existing ones and compiling them as blog posts which you can read [here](blog.markdown), once I've written everything up I intend to write new videos with companion blog posts at the same time.

I like lifting weights and axe throwing, not that I get the chance to throw axes especially often, mind. I also am a student of Scots Gaelic and would love to see some resources and languages using it. Maybe one day I'll be able to make some myself.
