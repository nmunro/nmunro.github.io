## About Me

---

### Personal

I'm a software engineer/tutor in the North West of England, where I work for [CodeNation](https://wearecodenation.com/ "CodeNation") as a senior instructor. I teach JavaScript, Python, git, testing, CI/CD, as well as techniques such as OOP and FP, it's challenging, but a lot of fun, very rewarding.

I've been programming in one form or another for the last twenty years, with a BSc in computer science and ten years experience in the industry. My primary programming language is Python, which I started using in 2008 and have continued to use ever since.
